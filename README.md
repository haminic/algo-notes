# Algorithm Notes

## â–¸ About ðŸ“–

This repository contains the source code of my personal notes (in Thai) on **Algorithms**, written in $\LaTeX$. These notes are a product of my study of *"Introduction to Algorithms"* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS), supplemented with other materials I see fit. I've also included the compiled PDF file [here](main.pdf) for ease of access.

These notes are a **work in progress** and meant for **personal use**, so it may contain errors, omissions, or unclear explanations. Please donâ€™t rely on them as an authoritative source. That said, I do hope it can still serve as useful to some.

This repository is public only for convenience, so I'd prefer it not be forked. If youâ€™d like to suggest improvements or corrections and you know me, feel free to reach out.

The notes are primarily based on *"Introduction to Algorithms"* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS), along with additional material from other textbooks and online resources. The referenced materials are listed (in no specific order) below:
